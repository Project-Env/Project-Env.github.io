## Why Project-Env?

Working on multiple projects often means juggling different versions of the same tools.
One project needs GraalVM, another needs Temurin, and a third requires a specific NodeJS version.
Keeping these in sync across your IDE, shell, and CI environment is tedious and error-prone.

Project-Env solves this with a single `project-env.toml` configuration file per project.

		Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Environment-agnostic" icon="setting">
		Integrates with IDEs, CI pipelines, and shell environments through a single configuration.
