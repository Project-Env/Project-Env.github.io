This plugin configures tools set up by the Project-Env CLI, as far as possible, in the IntelliJ project settings.

Currently, the following project settings are configured automatically if the tool is declared:

- **JDK**: Adds the JDK to the JDK table and sets it as project JDK
- **Maven**:
  - Sets the project specific path to Maven to the corresponding location.
  - Makes all environment variables of all declared tools available to Maven executions
  - Configures the user specific settings file -- the global settings file is (if existing) linked into the Maven distribution.
- **Gradle**:
  - Sets the project specific path to Gradle to the corresponding location.
  - Makes all environment variables of all declared tools available to Gradle executions
- **Node**: Adds a new interpreter and sets it as project default interpreter

<Aside type="caution">
Changes in the `project-env.toml` file are only loaded once after opening the project. Afterwards, Project-Env must be manually refreshed by using the action under **Tools** > **Project-Env** > **Refresh**.
