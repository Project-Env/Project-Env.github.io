This action sets up the runner environment with Project-Env. It downloads the CLI, runs `project-env-cli install`, and configures all tool paths and environment variables for subsequent workflow steps.

## Inputs

### `cli-version`

**Required.** Version of [Project-Env CLI](https://github.com/Project-Env/project-env-cli) to use.

### `cli-debug`

Whether to activate the debug mode of the [Project-Env CLI](https://github.com/Project-Env/project-env-cli).

## Example usage

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - uses: project-env/project-env-github-action@v1.5.0
    with:
      cli-version: '3.26.0'

  - run: java --version
  - run: mvn --version
```

After the action runs, all tools declared in your `project-env.toml` are available on `PATH` with the correct environment variables set.
